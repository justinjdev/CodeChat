----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) insert a User record (when a user registers)

	general:
		insert into Users values (u_id, u_email, u_password, u_username, u_firstname, u_lastname);

	examples:
		insert into "Users" values (435, 'somemail@email.com', 'somepass', 'a_username', 'Firstname', 'Last');

	notes:
		<none>

2) insert a Message record (when a message/code is sent)

	general:
		case 1) insert into Message values (m_id, ch_id, u_id, 'message_text', isCode, null, time, hasInputs);

		case 2) insert into Message values (m_id, ch_id, u_id, 'message_text', isCode, null, time, hasInputs);
				update Message set m_response = 'sandbox_response' where m_id = INTEGER;

	examples:
		case 1) insert into "Message" values (7779, 4, 7777, 'yas', FALSE, null, 1509729506, FALSE);

		case 2) insert into "Message" values (1234, 6, 8989, '/python\n\tprint(''Hello World'')', TRUE, null, 1509729506, FALSE);
				update "Message" set m_response = 'Hello World' where m_id = 7777;

	notes:
		-no matter what, when inserting a message into DB, the m_response field is null, the sandbox is what will change it from null
		-if the isCode field is false, then do not send to sandbox
		-if the isCode field is true, then send to sandbox and perform the update query on m_response using the returned sandbox string
		-if isCode is true, then the backend must also check if there is inputs, if there is, then set hasInputs to true, false otherwise
		-the escape sequence for a single quote (') is two single quotes (''), example of this above in the python "Hello World"

3) insert a Channel record (when a new channel is created)

	general:
		insert into Channel values (ch_id, 'language')

	examples:
		insert into "Channel" values (55, 'Ada');

	notes:
		-this will be a function used by admins to create a new supported language channel, and also users to make private channel

4) insert a Users_In_Channel record (when a user joins a channel)

	general:
		insert into Users_In_Channel (u_id, ch_id);

	examples:
		insert into "Users_In_Channel" values (1, 12);

	notes:
		<none>

5) get list of all User emails (used to determine if an email has already been registered)

	general:
		select u_email from Users order by u_email;

	examples:
		select u_email from "Users" order by u_email;

	notes:
		-returns all emails in ascending order
		-for some reason, you need quotes around table names here and for all other queries for it to work

6) get the list of all usernames currently in a channel (to display in the GUI so people can see who is in channel)

		general:
			select u_username from Users natural join Users_In_Channel where ch_id = INTEGER;

		examples:
			select u_username from "Users" natural join "Users_In_Channel" where ch_id = 1;

		notes:
			-the above example lists all of the users who are in channel with id of 1

7) change a username (in case a user wants to change their username)

	general:
		update Users set u_username = 'new_name' where u_id = INTEGER;

	examples:
		update "Users" set u_username = 'Dat_Boi' where u_id = 4321;

	notes:
		<none>

8) change a channel name (in case a user wants to change the name of a private channel or admin the name of general channel)

		general:
			update Channel set ch_name = 'new_name' where ch_id = INTEGER;

		examples:
			update "Channel" set ch_name = 'Ada' where ch_id = 14;

		notes:
			<none>

9) change a user bio (when a user wants to change their bio)

	general:
		update Users set u_bio = 'new_bio' where u_id = INTEGER;

	examples:
		update "Users" set u_bio = 'I changed my name' where u_id = 4321;

	notes:
		<none>

10) user search function (can specify 1. a category (Message, User, Channel), 2. then keyword(s))

	general:
		case 1) select * from TABLE_NAME where ATTRIBUTE_NAME like '%keyword_list%';
		case 2) select * from TABLE_NAME where ATTRIBUTE_NAME like 'keyword';

	examples:
		case 1) select * from "Message" where m_text like '%python print%';
		case 2) select * from "Users" where u_username like 'Dat_Boi';
		case 2) select * from "Channel" where ch_name like 'C';

	notes:
		-case 1 is to search loosely by inputting a list of keyword(s) that appear anywhere sequentially in a table
		-case 2 is to search strictly by inputting a list of keyword(s) and looking for a table with just those words and nothing more
		-this search returns entire tuples, so all information is available

11) delete a channel (when admin wants to delete a channel or a user wants to delete a private channel)

	general:
		delete from Channel where ch_id = INTEGER;
		delete from Users_In_Channel where ch_id = INTEGER;
		delete from Message where ch_id = INTEGER;

	examples:
		delete from "Channel" where ch_id = 99;
		delete from "Users_In_Channel" where ch_id = 99;
		delete from "Message" where ch_id = 99;

	notes:
		-the ch_id is the same for all three operations
		-all three operations happen one after another in order to completely remove all traces of a channel from DB
		-because you must 1. delete the channel, 2. delete the messages in the channel, 3. remove the users from that channel

12) delete a user from a channel (when a user leaves a channel)

	general:
		delete from Users_In_Channel where ch_id = INTEGER and u_id = INTEGER;

	examples:
		delete from "Users_In_Channel" where ch_id = 1 and u_id = 25;

	notes:
		-must specify which channel and which user
		-the user will be removed from the channel, and every message that they sent will remain for the life of the channel
